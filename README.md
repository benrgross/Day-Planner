# Day-Planner

In this easy to use day planner, the user is able to select the text area of the times listed for the working hours of the day, and type their own reminders. Once a a reminder is typed, the user can save the reminder to be viewed on the page even after the page is refreshed. The color of the of each time block changes with the time of day to inform the user if a task is in the present, past or future hour of the day.

The day planner application utilizes jQuery to handle DOM traversal, manipulation, and event handling. Local storage was utilized to store and retrieve input data. Media Capture and Streams API was linked to the document via a cnd to provide the current date and time, allowing for the dynamic manipulation of css styles that wer handled once again with jQuery.
